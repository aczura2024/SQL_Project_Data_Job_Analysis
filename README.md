# Introduction

I completed the course SQL for Data Analytics by Luke Barousse (https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA) to upgrade my SQL skills. 


# Background
The data I used contained information on thousands of job postings in data-related roles. This was obtained from the SQL for Data Analytics Course by course by Luke Barousse (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1moeWYoUtUklJO6NJdWo9OV8zWjRn0rjN)

To understand more about the data analytcs job market in Canada, such as the top-paying jobs, most in-demand skills,  I used this data to conduct various relevant queries.


The main questions governing this analysis were:

- What data analyst jobs are the highest paying?
- What skills are required for top-paying jobs?
- What skills are in highest demand for data analysts?
- Which skills lead to higher salaries?
- What are the optimal skills to learn?



# Tools I used
* SQL: For accessing job data within a database and easy query writing.
* PostgreSQL: Used as the server.
* Visual Studio Code: Used to conviently write code in a comprehensive environment.
* GitHub: To display project for others to see.


# The Analysis
Each of the 5 queries was aimed at answering a different question relating to the data analytics job market in Canada. Below I give a description of how each question is answered. 



**1. 10 Highest Paid Data Analyst Jobs in Canada**

I sorted data analyst jobs by salary and specified Canada as the location. The query below shows how I did this.

```sql
-- Jobs in Canada

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title_short,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_location LIKE '%Canada%' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC   
Limit 10
```


Here is a summary of the results from the above query:
- The salary range is rather narrow for the top 10 data analyst jobs, ranging from $100,500 CAD to $111,175 CAD.
- The employers offering these jobs are large financial services companies, such as Stripe, Sunlife and ATB Financial.
- There is variation in job titles, ranging from Data Analyst, Analytics Engineering Lead and Analytics Lab Architect, showing a range of specializations and roles.

**2. Skills Needed in Canada's Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs**

To learn more about the ideal skillset for a Canadian Data Analyst, I joined the job postings with the skills data to reveal which skills are correlated with higher salaries.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location LIKE '%Canada%' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC    
    Limit 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
