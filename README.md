# Introduction

I completed the course SQL for Data Analytics by Luke Barousse (https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA) to upgrade my SQL skills. 


# Background
The data I used contained information on thousands of job postings in data-related roles. This was obtained from the course by Luke Barousse (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1moeWYoUtUklJO6NJdWo9OV8zWjRn0rjN)

To understand more about the data analytcs job market, such as the top-paying jobs, most in-demand skills,  I used this data to conduct various relevant queries.


The main questions governing this analysis were:

- What data analyst jobs are the highest paying?
- What skills are required for top-paying jobs?
- What skills are in highest demand for data analysts?
- Which skills lead to higher salaries?
- What are the optimal skills to learn?



# Tools I used
* SQL:
* PostgreSQL:
* Visual Studio Code
* GitHub


# The Analysis
Each of the 5 queries was aimed at 



```sql
SELECT

```
